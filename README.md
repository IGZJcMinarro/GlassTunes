GlassTunes
==========

A demonstration of the new XDI interface added in Google Music. This app is intended to run on Google Glass. Google Play Music v5.2.1204L.814012 or higher must also be loaded on the device.

Note: the RemoteMetadataProvider subproject relies on hidden Android APIs and needs to be built against a modified Android.jar. I'll be removing this from the source tree and re-adding it as a jar dependancy soon.
